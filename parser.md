## Parser Overview

### About This Document

Owen's Markup Language (`owml` from now on) is a lightweight markup language. You can find the design specifications [here](language-spec.md).

In this document, we will briefly go over how to build from source and setup this parser in various enviroments.

### About `owml-parser`

`owml-parser` is a parser for [omwl](language-spec.md). It is made in Rust using the [nom](https://docs.rs/nom/5.0.0/nom/) library. This project aims to be no-std, meaning that it does not ship with a standard library, making it lighter weight and poetntially avalible on embedded devices.

This respository (<https://gitlab.com/scOwez/owml-parser>) could be considered the main "hub" of Owen's Markup Language, containing documentation for Owen's Markup Language itself alongside the core, standardized parser for owml itself.

If you would like to use this parser and you are not using Rust, there is a handy [Ecosystem section](../../README.md#ecosystem-earth_africa) in the README, containing links to various bindings and implamentations of owml.

## Installing

In this section, we will be going over how to install this parser.

### Downloading `owml-parser`

The most recently passing [job artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pipelines/job_artifacts.html) (the system owml uses to automatically generate binaries on a sucsessful [CI run](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)).

1. To get these "artifacts", please visit the **[Pipelines](https://gitlab.com/scOwez/owml-parser/pipelines)** page for owml and find the most recent passing build. It should have an icon similar to:

    ![Example icon](https://i.imgur.com/o7kw9J8.png)

2. If a job has an icon like this, please view to the right of it where it should have the following button:

    ![Example download button](https://i.imgur.com/C50nhJ0.png)

3. Please press the dropdown button and select `Download img-build artifacts`.

4. Once you have downloaded the file, please unzip it and extract the `libowml-parser.rlib` file that should be located inside of the `target/release/` folder.

5. Congratulations! You have sucsessfully downloaded the cutting-edge owml release!

### Building From Source

1. To build from source, please first clone the git repository.

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/scOwez/owml-parser
    ```

2. Once you have the [git repository for owml](https://gitlab.com/scOwez/owml-parser/) saved locally, you will need to install Rust if you haven't already. You can find the steps to do this [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install/).

3. After installing Rust, please `cd` into `owml-parser/` and execute the following command to build owml

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

4. This will build a release version of owml. It is reccomended to use the **nightly** version of Rust as it is guaranteed to work compared to Rust stable.

5. Once the build has completed, you can use the `owml-parser` library. The .rlib file (by default) is stored in the newly-created `target/release/` directory and should be called something similarly to **`owml_parser.rlib`**.
