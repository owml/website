As i'm sure you are aware by the title of this post, Owen's Markup Language 0.1.0 has been officially released **[on Crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/owml-parser)**!

This is quite a large milestone for owml; the first stable launch! I'll continually update it with these main issues to tackle for the 0.1.1 release:

- Reorganise structure (split parsers up): *[Issue link](https://gitlab.com/owml/owml-parser/issues/14)*.
- Use a standardized line ending system: *[Issue link](https://gitlab.com/owml/owml-parser/issues/15)*.
- Convert `tag()` into `char::<>` for a small speed boost: *[Issue link](https://gitlab.com/owml/owml-parser/issues/16)*.

Development may be slow some days as I work on properly documenting the parser and language specification, found on this website.

Thanks for reading! - *Owez*
