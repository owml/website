Welcome to the brand-new owml website! This is a small infomational website, dedicated to bringing the latest updates and announcements for Owen's Markup Language.

If you would like to setup or contribute to `omwl` for yourself, you can find the parser/"core" of owml [here](https://gitlab.com/scOwez/owml-parser).

Thanks for reading! - *scOwez*
